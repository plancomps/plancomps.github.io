# Semantic descriptions library

[![Screen Shot 2014-08-19 at 09.55.00](https://plancomps.csle.cs.rhul.ac.uk/files/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-19-at-09.55.00-300x212.png)](https://plancomps.csle.cs.rhul.ac.uk/files/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-19-at-09.55.00.png)

One of the PLanCompS goals (as a separate work package), involves obtaining, digitising, analysing and indexing existing language specifications, for inclusion in a digital library. The main contributor of this work is [Cliff Jones]( http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/). He worked with the IBM Vienna group on the operational semantics (VDL) description of programming languages in the late 1960s; on a second spell in Vienna he played a major part in the development of their denotational description method (VDM). He is co-editor or single author of all of the early books on VDM.

The current (evolving) contributions to the [*semantic descriptions library*](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/semantics-library/) being developed in the PLanCompS project include those aspects of “VDM” relating to language description that were firmed up in the IBM Laboratory in Vienna around a project to build a compiler from the PL/I language to the “FS” machine (that got cancelled).

- One direct output was “published” as the Technical Report on the [PL/I description](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/TR25139/) which has been scanned ([full citation](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/#BBHJL74)).
- Another report described the [overall method](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/Other-TRs/TR25.145.pdf) ([full citation](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/#Jones76a)).
- An older report investigated different [implementation techniques for reference to non-local variables](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/TR25.104.pdf) (Warning: this uses VDL notation!) ([full citation](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/#HenhaplJones70a)).

Other descriptions (follow the citation links to get to the pdf) using VDM include:

- [ALGOL 60](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/#HenhaplJones82x4) (historically, there is an [earlier version](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/#HenhaplJones78) in LNCS 61)
- [Pascal](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/semantics-library/#AndrewsHenhapl82)
