# A Modular Structural Operational Semantics for Delimited Continuations

By Neil Sculthorpe, Paolo Torrini, and Peter D. Mosses

## Abstract

> It has been an open question as to whether the Modular Structural Operational Semantics framework can express the dynamic semantics of *call/cc*. This paper shows that it can, and furthermore, demonstrates that it can express the more general delimited control operators *control* and *shift*.

- [Accompanying Material ZIP Archive](/files/2016/01/MSOS-continuations.zip)

The archive includes:

- a suite of 70 test programs, written in (extended) Caml Light;
- a translation from Caml Light to funcons, together with the generated funcon programs;
- I-MSOS specifications of funcons and auxiliary entities, together with the Prolog code generated from them; and
- the tools for translation, generation and interpretation.
