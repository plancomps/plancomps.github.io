# Funcons for HGMP

The fundamental constructs of homogeneous generative meta-programming

By [L. Thomas van Binsbergen](https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/publications)

## Abstract

> The PLanCompS project proposes a component-based approach to programming-language development in which fundamental constructs (funcons) are reused across language definitions. Homogeneous Generative Meta-Programming (HGMP) enables writing programs that generate code as data, at run-time or compile-time, for manipulation and staged evaluation. Building on existing formalisations of HGMP, this paper introduces funcons for HGMP and demonstrates their usage in component-based semantics.
